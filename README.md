# Collab-Repo

Everyone has been added as a collaborator to this repository, meaning you can all contribute files.

Click on the Code icon, SSH, and copy the address for the remote repository. **_Create a local repository_**
on your computer and link the two.

Once linked, make sure you **_pull_** all the files from main.

**_Create a new branch_**, including the last 4 digits of your student number at the end of the branch name.

Your task is to create a new file, where the file name follows the format `A_B_C.txt` where 
- A is your favourite colour
- B is your favourite animal
- C is a random number from 10 to 99

**Example:**
`Silver_Goldfish_22.txt`

**_Save, add, commit, and push_** the files to your branch.

Finally, create a **_pull request_** for your branch. Assign me (John-Spinelli) as a reviewer for your pull request.

Once everyone has completed this task, we will have a giant repository full of files through this collaborative exercise.
